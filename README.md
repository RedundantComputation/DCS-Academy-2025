# Collect Data

What kinds of data are you curious to find out more about? Here are some ideas:
- Weekly screen time usage
- Spotify listening time
- Twitch viewing time

Once you have decided on the kind of data you would like to explore, let's construct a dataset together. 
Here are some things to think about:
- What kind of information is important to represent? We call these data features.


# Sketching

Draw 2 or 3 ways you might want to visualize your data. Think about:

- What tasks will your visualization allow you to accomplish?

# Coding Visualization

Let's build our data visualization together.

First we'll pick a chart type to build off of.

Next, we can add additional elements to our visualization. Here are some suggestions:
- Buttons to toggle different categories/elements
- Sliders to control how much information is shown

If you would like a challenge, you can also build a separate visualization and see if you can control both at the same time!
This is called a linked view.

# Data Physicalization

Let's try to think outside-the-box now when it comes to visualizing your data. What other ways might you use to represent your data?
