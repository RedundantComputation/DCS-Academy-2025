# DCS-Academy-2025
Patrick &amp; Matthew's Personalized Info Vis Workshop for DCS Academy 2025

Data is all around us! But how do we make sense of data when there's so much of it? How can we see the big picture, uncover trends, and share our findings with other people? In this project, you'll learn all about the science (and art!) of **data visualization**. We'll talk about how to collect data, how to design effective/interesting/cool visualizations, and how to create those visualizations using code (and beyond)!

# What is Data Visualization?
To kick off our workshop, we'll talk about why we visualize data, what kinds of visualizations are out there, and look at some cool examples for inspiration.

# Collect Data

What kinds of data are you curious to find out more about? Here are some ideas:
- Weekly screen time usage
- Spotify listening time
- Twitch viewing time

Once you have decided on the kind of data you would like to explore, let's construct a dataset together. 
Here are some things to think about:
- What kind of information is important to represent? We call these data features.


# Sketching

Draw 2 or 3 ways you might want to visualize your data. Think about:

- What tasks will your visualization allow you to accomplish?

# Coding Visualization

Let's build our data visualization together.

First we'll pick a chart type to build off of.

Next, we can add additional elements to our visualization. Here are some suggestions:
- Buttons to toggle different categories/elements
- Sliders to control how much information is shown

If you would like a challenge, you can also build a separate visualization and see if you can control both at the same time!
This is called a linked view.

# Data Physicalization

Let's try to think outside-the-box now when it comes to visualizing your data. What other ways might you use to represent your data? Would your visualization benefit from being brought into the real, 3-dimensional world?
